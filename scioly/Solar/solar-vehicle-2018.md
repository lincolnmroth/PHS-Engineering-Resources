# Solar Vehicle 2017-18:

Solar vehicle was a trial event for Science Olympiad 2017-18, which means we only had 2 months to prepare.

\***Warning**\*

This is the worst thing I have ever built. I am terribly sorry.

### Design:

Even though we had 2 months to prepare for solar vehicle, I completely forgot about it until a few days before the competition. Since I had other events to work on, I put solar vehicle until the day before states.

I didn't really have any design, I planned on just building it out of random stuff I found in the lab. I did order two solar panels, neither of which I ended up using.

### Construction:

I ended up taking a solar panel phone charger and cutting it up to get one of the panels out. Since i wanted to reduce the weight as much as possible, I used the panel as the main chassis. I didn't have wheels or axles, so I found an empty box of wire spools, and used the spools as wheels and the plastic dowel as the front axle. I only had 3 spools, so I had the two on the front axle, and only one powered wheel in the back, which I attached to those standard yellow dc gearmotors.

### Summary:

Somehow it kinda worked and got 11th place, which is pretty good for the amount of work I put in. If i had time to actually engineer something, it could have been much, much better.

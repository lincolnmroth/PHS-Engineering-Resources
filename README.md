# PHS Engineering Resources

Here's a book with random resources, and knowledge to help become a better engineer meant for anyone, but made particularly for students at PHS, \(mainly students in PHSCRC, SciOly, other engineering clubs\)

I'm going to try and do as little explanation myself and outsource it to other places since I'm bad at explaining things.

All of the projects documented here will be from projects worked on at PHS. None of our personal projects will be on here, I have considered starting a blog/youtube channel/some other way documenting project to put personal projects on, but that probably won't happen anytime soon

Feel free to make a change request and add whatever you want!

# Mission Possible 2017-18

Mission Possible was an event in Science Olympiad in 2018
It involved building a Rube Goldberg machine to complete a set series of tasks

Mission was easily the largest time investment for building in 2018
The number of tasks and the limitations made the event extremely challenging

### Overall:
The most important thing to take away from Mission in 2018 is to never procrastinate on building- if we started when we wanted to start, there would have been much less stress and sadness in the process.

We began mission by outlining how we would do all the tasks. For example, we found chemical reactions that would perform the tasks, like an endothermic reaction and a gas-producing reaction. After figuring out the tasks, we drew up some very rough designs, mostly about the framework.

After drawing up the designs, we arrived on the metal frame design with plywood floors. The second floor was to be 30 cm above the second, and the whole Mission would fit in a 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm box, giving us a decent amount of room. Our plan also involved a huge number of Arduino Nanos, primarily obtained by ordering them. For our chemicals, we asked Dr. Corell for concentrated version of the solutions we needed, such as acetic acid. We ordered the parts and started working on the build- however, we ran into trouble, as multiple people had different ideas of what the build was. As a result, most of our transitions got messed up, and noone on the team quite knew everything that was happening.

Action Sequence Lists (ASLs) are under each competition

##### Islips

A while after we started building, our first invitational was coming up, so we started to frantically build actions and transitions. The week before, we made many of the electronics on the top floor, such as the IR sender/receiver and the photocell. However, because of some high quality procrastination, we decided to cut a lot of the actions before the invitational. However, 2 days before, the invitational was cancelled because of snow, to the relief of the building team. We had maybe 5 or 6 actions done, with both the starting and the ending action working, most of it put together rather haphazardly on the nicer framework we had built. During the mock invitational we decided to run, the build mostly worked as expected- some of our actions failed, but most of the Arduino stuff worked, despite being powered with a lot of 9V batteries and alligator clips. Mission, at this point, was relatively on track- after the makeup Islips results came back, we weren't too far behind some of the top teams from other regions (scoring about 700), so we felt fairly confident we could finish Mission before Princeton.


##### Princeton

Princeton was the second worst disaster for Mission in 2018, and possibly the most costly. Similar to Islips, we procasinated more, and ended up using a virtually identical Mission that we used for the mock invitational. We did obtain the chemicals from Corell, however, we weren't able to integrate them into the build. At the competition itself, because of bad preparation, nothing was secured on the framework- as a result, I lost a few important components of the build, such as the ending action's breadboard and Arduino, rather severely hurting our performance. Princeton was also the first invitational where we really got to see other Missions perform- the scores doubled, up to about 1300 for the top score and 1100 for the next few. Several people had nonfunctional or bad Missions as well, however, those tended towards the minority. The primary thing we learned from Princeton was that we couldn't have just a few actions to win, we needed every single task, including a rather complicated timing action. The scores were almost perfect- the top score would have included almost every action plus a good timing action. However, UPenn was coming next week, so we didn't have much time to prepare for the next disaster.

##### UPenn

UPenn was rather bad for Mission. We only had a week to improve our design from Princeton, so we 3D printed a bunch of parts (such as pulleys, which did not work very well) and started liberally using hot glue. We began to seriously integrate the second floor with new actions such as the coin flip and the homemade electromagnet. The day and night before, we went to Diane's house (thanks Diane :) ) and, in an all-nighter, built the bulk of mission. We had levers, the electromagnet, water activated action, all our previous stuff from Princeton, and better secured parts (primarily with tons of BLUE tape), with very sketchy chemical actions. However, the day of the competition, Mission flopped rather badly- our system for powering things with 9Vs didn't work with the greater number of Nanos we had, so we hadÂ some burnt Arduinos and powering issues. The second, more fatal issue, was that our transitions failed. A lot of the stuff we used to transition, mostly through random metal parts completing circuits, failed at the time of the competition. In addition, we couldn't get points for an action if we touched it, and since virtually none of our transitions worked, we ended up completing very, very few actions, maybe even worse than Princeton. We had a decent number of actions, but few of them actually worked properly, resulting in a rather disappointing invitational.

##### states

States was the worst disaster for Mission this year, not because of a bad build, but mostly because of poor results despite a huge time investment. We spent the 2 weeks after UPenn aggressively putting together much more consistent transitions, increasing our reliance on Arduinos. We also somewhat cleaned up our battery situation, by hooking up one battery to a huge clump of wires and branching off of that clump. A lot of our chemicals were finally in place, after missing them at UPenn and Princeton, with even more sketchy ways to activate and detect them. After a week of late nights at Diane's, and another all-nighter, we were only missing 2 actions and a timing action- for states, a max of 280 (50 + 50 + 90 * 2 timing max) points missing- a relatively high scoring Mission, which would most likely be able to place at Princeton if everything worked. However, at States, nothing worked. Despite our consistent transitions and new setups, every single action had a new point of failure. Last-minute construction issues, such as glue not holding, screwdriver missing in tool box, and Nanos not properly powered wrecked our run. During our 30 minute setup, we focused on preparing chemicals and checking our actions. At that point, our chemical reactions were properly prepared, and only our ending action was not working- a significant loss of points, but not the end of Mission. Once we powered it on and showed the judges, failures began. Electronics that were tested 5 minutes before the run failed, and none of the chemical actions even triggered. Somehow, miraculously, we still got 12th place out of about 30, despite only really completing under 5 actions. We will never know why Mission was such a spectacular failure at States in 2018- maybe it was the bus ride, maybe it was a wiring issue, maybe the stars aligned and fried all our Arduinos. It is worth noting that other people had Missions that were rather bad as well- Mission is an event where the invitationals will probably have teams that have worked extremely hard on Mission as their only priority, while States may not have those same teams. Our issue with States was that we didn't prepare enough in the November-February time period, resulting in us rushing construction and making very sketchy solutions with hot glue and balloons. Our competative run for Mission in 2018 was bad, with States being the culmination of that run. With such a weird and difficult event, a solid plan and a spread out time committment is necessary, which, in this year, we failed to achieve.

Mission was rather bad in 2018. The difficulty and time commitment required for a good build was not recognized early, and we paid for it with our health. In the end, we put a lot of time into a lot of solid ideas, and the building team did gain a ton of experience. However, it should have gone better, especially at States, with small failures that caused nothing to work. Quite the difficult event, with so many quirks and sketchiness that communication, knowledge over the rules, and timeleness are absolutely essential. Although the build may not have done that well, it was an interesting learning experience for the building team, with many disappointments and not a lot of success.

### Notes for the Future

Hook up the battery first if there is a one battery bonus, it makes testing 10x easier.
Try to use household chemicals, rather than lab chemicals from teachers- makes trial runs and safety issues painless
Completing a circuit is vague in rules- can be with buttons or switches
Read the rules very carefully- someone lost an action because of an ordering issue- their weight didn't lift 10 cm before activating the next action, losing them points
Unified design- everyone needs to know what to do
Actions first- if its early on and a unified design hasn't been done, people can build individual actions and worry about transitions later
Space is not the winning factor- many missions were somewhat bulky, although ours was on the large side- try to get small materials, but its not a priority
Timing action is also non-essential- chemical timing actions are a pain in the ass and I would recommend taking the point loss
Cram as many actions as possible in early- try not to miss anything if you can
Scioly has glassware if you need chemicals
Try making a list of actions and just writing what you might be able to do, see what sticks
3D printing everything is not the best idea- airtight things do not need to be printed, and often a non-printed solution will work just as well
You can borrow weights from Higgins (but try to return them)
This event will wreck your health, both physical and mental
Balloons and hot glue form nice seals- would recommend
Aluminum foil is good for completing circuits- but is hard to work with, would not recommend

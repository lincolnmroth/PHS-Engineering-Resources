# Basic circuits

Even though I just said you do not need in-depth E&M knowledge, you do need a basic understanding of circuits, which I will go over here. I'll mainly be providing videos for these, as it is much easier to understand than me writing. Also I will talk more about these topics later on in more depth.  
Heres what I'll go over:

* Basic electrical terms \(Voltage, Current, Resistance ...\)
* Basic electric components \(Resistors, Capacitors, LED's ...\)
* Transistors
* maybe some other stuff?

## Electrical Terminology

[Here's](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law) a good article on basic electronic terminology.

### Voltage

Voltage is the electrical potential different across two points. Voltage is measured in volt which is Energy\(Joules\)/charge\(Coulomb\)

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qfhFXjsrw) a goood video on voltage.

### Current

Current is the rate of flow of electric charge. It is measure in Amperes \(Amps\), which is 1 Coulomb/second

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwNj9uauJ4) a good video on current.

### Resistance

[Heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jB6hDUqN0Y) a good video on resistance and Ohm's Law.

Ohm's law is V=IR or Voltage\(in Volts\) = Current\(in Amperes/Amps\) \* Resistance \(in Ohms\)

### Power

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8JQTLkV5C8) a good video on electric power.

Power is V\*I

## Types of circuits

## Series and Parallel

Here's a good video on series and parallel circuits

## Electrical Components

The most important electrical component for prototyping is a breadboard. Breadboard's make it very easy to make connections between components.

This is a breadboard:

and this is how it is connected on the inside:

I'm using [tinkercad's](/://www.tinkercad.com) circuit functionality, which I don't particularly like, but it is pretty good for teaching/learning basic electronics.

We'll start with this circuit and build off it while learning about new components.

As you see, I have a 5v power supply that is turning a light bulb. Pretty simple, right?

### Resistors

If say we were being blinded by this light, we can lower the brightness by using a resistor.

I added a 1K, or 1000, Ohm resistor. To determine the resistance of a resistor, they are color coded with the resistance. Here's a chart:

But if you are lazy, like me, and do not want to look up a chart on resistors, I highly recommend this [Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Roth-Resistor-Codes/dp/B071X6XBXW/) skill which does it for you, and was most definitely not made by me.

Another type of resistor is a variable resistor. These are more commonly called potentiometers. They are usually dials that change resistance based on the angle that it has been turned. This circuit allows us to change the brightness of the light based on the pot.

### Buttons/Switches

Next we'll use a button. Button's are very simple, they are just switches that open and close circuits.

So now, our light will only turn on when we are pressing the button.

All buttons/switches are made differently, so always test the leads to see which ones get connected.

### Capacitors

Capacitors are a way of storing electricity. [Here's](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/capacitors) an article on them.

This circuit I built allows the capacitor to be charged once the button is pressed, so when the button is released, the light stays on for a second or two.

I am using a 1000 microfarad capacitor and a 470 ohm resistor.

### Diodes

Diodes are kinda like a one way valve, they allow current to flow in one direction, but not the other.

One popular type of diodes are Light Emitting Diodes, or LEDs.

### Transistors

[Here's](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors) a good article about transistors.

Transistors are a really broad topic, and can be used in so many different ways.

### Batteries:

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EB7NVA7rI4) a good video on batteries.

# Basic circuits
Even though I just said you do not need in-depth E&M knowledge, you do need a basic understanding of circuits, which I will go over here.
Heres what I'll go over:
* Basic electrical terms (Voltage, Current, Resistance ...)
* Basic electric components (Resistors, Capacitors, LED's ...)
* Transistors
* maybe some other stuff?

## Electrical Terminology

### Voltage
  Voltage is the potential 
### Current

### Resistance

### Power


## Electrical Components

### Resistors

### Capacitors

### Diodes

### Transistors

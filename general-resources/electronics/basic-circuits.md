# Basic circuits

Even though I just said you do not need in-depth E&M knowledge, you do need a basic understanding of circuits, which I will go over here. I'll mainly be providing videos for these, as it is much easier to understand than me writing. Also I will talk more about these topics later on in more depth.  
Heres what I'll go over:

* Basic electrical terms \(Voltage, Current, Resistance ...\)
* Basic electric components \(Resistors, Capacitors, LED's ...\)
* Transistors
* maybe some other stuff?

## Electrical Terminology

[Here's](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law) a good article on basic electronic terminology.

### Voltage

Voltage is the electrical potential different across two points. Voltage is measured in volt which is Energy\(Joules\)/charge\(Coulomb\)

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qfhFXjsrw) a goood video on voltage.

### Current

Current is the rate of flow of electric charge. It is measure in Amperes \(Amps\), which is 1 Coulomb/second

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwNj9uauJ4) a good video on current.

### Resistance

[Heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jB6hDUqN0Y) a good video on resistance and Ohm's Law.

Ohm's law is V=IR or Voltage\(in Volts\) = Current\(in Amperes/Amps\) \* Resistance \(in Ohms\)

### Power

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8JQTLkV5C8) a good video on electric power.

Power is V\*I

# Wireless Communications

Having interned at a wireless communications lab, I kinda felt like I had to put something together, but I'm going to keep it short and pretty concise, because I could go on all day explaining how all the different parts of WIFI or BLE work, so I'm only going to talk about them in the form of the electronics. I'd be more than willing to talk about wireless communication if you have any question.

## WIFI

WIFi. Our entire lives revolve around wifi, but integrating it into electronics isn't particularly simple. But some chips have made it easier. To use WIFI, either get a wifi board off of adafruit or sparkfun, or use an ESP8266.

## Bluetooth

## Radio

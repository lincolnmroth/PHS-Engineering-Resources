# Wire

Electronics are useless if there's no way of connecting everything together. That's why we have wire.

## Types of wire:

There are two types of wire, solid core and stranded core.

### Solid core

Solid core wire is when there is just one conductor in the wire. This is frequently used in breadboards, as they plug in very easily. This is pretty much the only use of solid core wire, but it is still very important because of this.

### Stranded core

Stranded core wire is what you should should pretty much all the time, except when prototyping. Here are some of the benefits:

* It is much more flexible, and does not break as easily
* It can handle more current
* It crimps easier to connectors
* It solders easier \(my opinion, some people wrongly think solid core is easier to solder

### Wire bunches

Sometimes you need multiple wires going to places in your robot. Instead of having a rat's nest of wires, you can get cables with multiple wires in them.

Here are my favorite types to use:

* cat5
* IDE
* Ribbon cable
* RS232

#### Cat5

cat5 is my favorite type of cable to use. It is the same wire used in ethernet cables. Here are the benefits of it:

* Super cheap
* Nice, high quality wire
* Can get both stranded and solid core variety
* 8 conductors
* organized in 4 pairs 
* pairs are twisted together to get rid of interference/noise

#### IDE

Sometimes I use IDE cables as well. I'm not a huge fan of them except when using them with raspberry pi's, as they are the perfect size.![](/assets/ide.png)

#### Ribbon Cable

Ribbon cable is just a bunch of wire together, but is very useful. It's useful when making custom wiring harnesses.

#### RS232\(VGA\)

RS232 cable is ocassionaly used in CNC mills, but as I have never built a CNC mill \(yet\), I have never used and cannot say much about it.

## Thickness of wire

The thickness wire of wire you choose is VERY important. If you use wire that is too thin, it could overheat and catch fire. Which would be bad. Very bad.

Wire thickness is measure in AWG \(Gauge\).

Here's a chart of amperage rating of different wire guages:

## Connectors

Wire's aren't useful if there's no way of connecting them, here are some connection types.

Also one thing to take note of is that there are both male and female connectors. Male connectors plug into the female connectors\(for obvious reasons\).  
I'll talk about how to make custom cables with connectors in the next section, electrical tools.

### IEC

IEC cables are very standard for being on power supplies. They are the same connector that goes into your PC.

### Bullet connector

Bullet connectors are a way of connecting one wire to another. They are a very good combination of both being a very good connection and unlikely to fall out, but are still easy enough to remove and swap. They are frequently used on ESC's \(Electronic Speed Controllers\)

### dupont

Dupont connectors are great because they plug into breadboards very nicely. Also a lot of sensors use them, so if you need to make cables for them, it is recommend you use them.

### Powerpole

Power pole connectors are frequently used in high power cases. They are used in combat robotics and also in FRC \(I hate FRC. It's terrible. Nothing is worse\)

### XT

XT connectors are another great connector for high power cases. They are frequently used in all fields of robotics from combat robots to drones.

They come in 3 main sizes, 30, 60 and 90. I like to use 60 for pretty much everything, but if you are building like a featherweight combat robot and you have a 24v system, you might want to step up to xt 90.

### jst

Jst are a popular battery connector for small batteries. They are frequently used in very small drones.

### rj45

rj45 connectors are not great for high power, but are very good for carrying signals. RJ45 is what ethernet cable uses. ![](/assets/rj45.png)

### D-sub

D-sub is the category of connectors that vga cables fall under. They are also for signlas, not high power

### Molex

Molex sucks. Don't use it. It's frequently used for cheap computer fans.

### Barrel Jack

Barrel jacks are a good way to power small electronics.

### USB

USB. Oh, USB. Why are you such a confusing connector.

There are many, many types of usb connectors, and I'll try and go over as many of them as possible.

#### USB A

USB A is your standard USB connector that is on your laptop:

#### USB B

USB B is for peripherals such as printers and arduino uno's:

#### USB micro a and b 

micro USB is what is found on most android phones and some smaller arduinos:

#### usb micro a 3.0

usb micro 3.0 is weird, and very few people used it. Except samsung.

#### USB mini a and b

mini USB is what is freqeuently used on cameras and also arduino nanos:

#### USB C

USB C is great. It's just pretty new, but it is the future. It's making it's way to some android phones and is becoming more mainstream.

# Making stuff move

So making stuff move is my favorite part of robotics and is my main focus and is the area that I am the most knowledgable, so this will either be a very good article, or it will be horrible. My apologies in advance if it's completely unclear and discombobulated.

### Standard Brushed DC Motor

Standard dc motors are the simplest type of motor. They are the only type of motor that you can just plug into a battery and have it spin, which is why they are what you see in your physics class when learning basic e&m. They are very simple, cheap, and can be relatively powerful, but they do break more easily than other types of motors, and also have very low torque at low speeds, which can be a real pain sometimes.

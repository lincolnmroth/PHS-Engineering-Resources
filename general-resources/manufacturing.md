# Manufacturing

So this is similar to the 3D printing dilemna I have. Manufacturing \(specifically automated manufacturing\) is probably my largest focus and is what most of robotics knowledge is focused around. So I'm not really sure where to start or anything, but I'll try to do it this summer \(2018\). We'll see.

Coming Soon! maybe

# 3D Printing

Yeah, so I'm not sure I can do this. I have no idea even where to start. I have spent wayyy too much of my life learning about 3d printing, it would be impossible to write it all down.

Well I'm going to try anyway.

I'm going to start with how to use the printers, then go to how printers work, then go to printer maintenance, then go to printer design.

# Printer usage:

Here are the steps for using the printers. Make sure you follow all the steps or things won't work.

1. Get an .STL file. 
2. Ask Lincoln if you are allowed to print. If yes, continue to next steps. If no, do not push it, he holds grudges and won't let you print anything for a long time \(ask stonny if you don't believe me\).
3. Open Slic3r and load the object
4. Set print settings
5. Slice the object
6. Load .gcode file onto SD Card
7. Print from SD Card

## Get .STL File

To get an .STL file, you either download it from the internet or make it yourself. Making it yourself is better and Lincoln \(next step\) is much more likely to let you print. Most CAD programs have an export as .stl option or saving as .stl is part of the save as menu. Also you can download .stls from Thingiverse or myminifactory or some site like that.

## Ask Lincoln if you can print

Do not forget this step. Do not try and circumvent Lincoln \(also do not pass go, or collect $200\). As of the 2018-19 school year, he has authority over all of the the 3D Printers. If you do not want to ask him, you can ask Mrs. Elia, and she will ask him for you. He will likely just print the model for you, but the point of this article is to teach you about 3D Printers, so I'll go over it all.

## Open Slic3r

Slic3r PE is the slicing program we usually use \(unless you're using one of the makerbots which are very yuck\). It can be downloaded from prusas website, https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/. Unzip the folder and put it into your applications folder. Then open up Slic3r. When first opening it will ask which printer configs you want. Currently \(as of July 2018\), we have a Prusa i3 MK2, MK2 MMU, and a MK3 \(and like 3 broken makerbots which may or may not ever get fixed\), all with .4mm nozzles. I do not see us getting a new printer any time soon, but getting new nozzles is completely within the realm of possibility. 

To load objects, click add in the top left corner and select the object from your file system.

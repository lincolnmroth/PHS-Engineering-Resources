# Construction skills

So this is a rather broad topic. But I'll throw together random guides for whatever tools/construction methods I have experience in and try to throw in as many tips, tricks, and weird hacks I've learned over the years.

This may be one of my longest articles. So I'd probably just recommend just going to the parts you want/need.

Also reading this will be mandatory for using certain tools in the annex in addition to in-person tool training.

Here are the main things I'll go over:

* Measuring
* Fasteners
* Drills
* Hammers/mallets/press
* Grabbing/cutting tools \(pliers, vice grips, etc...\)
* Glues
* Hand saws
* Power saws
* Router
* Sanding
* Soldering 
* Wire handling \(stripping, crimping\)
* Welding
* Machining
* Mills
* Lathes
* CNC
* Vacuum Forming

## Measuring

The ability to measure accurately is one of the most underrated and most difficult parts of engineering. Measuring is our way of quantifying our surroundings.There are many types of measurement devices, but I'll only go over the common ones that you'd use.

### Length

There are many different ways of measuring length. There are rulers and meter sticks which you are all familiar. Also measuring tapes are very useful for longer length. But for accurate measurement a pair of digital calipers or a digital micrometer should be used. Calipers are probably one of my most used tools, and I always carry a pair on me. They allow you to measure outer lengths, inner lengths, and depths. I recommend Mitutoyo Calipers but they are kinda pricey, and you can find a decent pair on amazon for like $15.![](/assets/calipers.png)

Also always use metric. Imperial is stupid. Also make sure your calipers are zeroed before you start measuring.

### Mass

Use a scale. I'm really not sure what else to say about that.

### Time

Use a phone timer or record whatever you want to measure in high speed video and look at the timestamps to figure out time elapsed.

### Temperature

You can always use a normal thermometer, but LASERS! Laser IR thermometers are really fun and practical. Another tool that is super useful. Also some multimeters come with thermistor inputs which can be useful.

### Electricity \(Voltage, current, resistance, all that jazz\)

I already go over Electrical tools in my [Electrical Tools article.](/general-resources/electronics/electrical-tools.md)

## Fasteners:

Basically engineering is just putting things together in different ways, and there are many ways of putting things togethers. Fasteners are great.

### Screws/Bolts

I already went over these in [Structural System.](/general-resources/robotics/structural-system.md)

### Rivets

Rivets are a great more permanent solution than bolts or screws. I rarely use them do to the fact that they are permanent and I make mistakes so modularity is my best friend.

## Drills

I really like drills, and I use them almost daily. As I am fairly experience, if you watch me drill it may look not look safe, but it is \(fuck you stephane\).

The drill/impact driver combo we have at school is a 20v dewalt system and it's one of the best handheld drills I have used. We also have a nice bit set and impact driver bit set. Also we have a drill press in the back which is nice for drilling straight holes.

So you may think you know how to use a drill, but you probably don't. So I'll go over the different parts of a drill and how to use it. Then I'll do the same with the drill press.

![](/assets/drillparts.png)

One thing to note with all tools is that you need to feel and understand the tool. If the tool is struggling, slow down. Don't push your tools too hard. Getting a feeling for tools only comes with experience but it's really important to pay attention to your tools \(sound, feel, even smell\).

So back to drills.

The most important thing is safety \(it's actually third, but whatever\). So there are a few steps you need to ensure your safety. First, wear eye protection. I know it's a pain, but do it anyway. Secondly, you need proper work holding. Don't drill into the table your working on, but also make sure your piece is clamped down firmly so it doesn't go flying.  Also you your bit needs to be secure in your chuck. To do this in most modern drills you insert the bit into the chuck, and then hold the chuck while pressing the trigger making the drill spin clockwise. To remove the bit you do the same but rotate the drill counterclockwise. Some older drills have a a gear that needs tightening

![](/assets/drillchucktightening.png)This is also how you tighten the chuck on a drill press.

But before you can actually put a bit in, you need to choose a bit. This mainly comes down to experience. Sometimes you can just choose the right size bit and go for it, and sometimes you need to start small, and gradually increase the size. Also there are many different types of bits.

![](/assets/drillbits1.png)

![](/assets/wooddrillbits.png)

Now you have a bit and it is securely chucked into your drill, you can start drilling. Don't try and drill to fast and make sure you are drilling straight.

Drill presses are similar but also fairly different.

One main difference, especially with ours, is that it does not have variable speed control. It is either on or off.

![](/assets/drillpress.png)To change the speed you need to change the ratio on the pulleys in the head. Do not do this. Tell me that you need it changed, and I'll do it for you. It can be dangerous. Also you use the quill \(handle on the right hand side\) to drill. Also on the left hand side there is a depth guide for drilling accurate depths.

## Hammers/mallets/press

So the first thing you need to learn how to do with a hammer is to flip it.

![](/assets/hammerflip.png)Just kidding. Mrs. Elia gets annoyed when you do that, so don't.

So hammers and mallets are pretty self explanatory, but just to clarify the difference. Mallets have a rubbber or wood head, while hammers have metal heads.

One similar pressing device is called a press. The most popular one \(which I'm hoping to add to the annex in the near future\) is the arbor press.

![](/assets/arborpress.png)

Arbor presses are used for excerting a large force on a small surface area, for edxample they are used for press fitting bearings into place.

## Grabbing tools \(pliers, vice grips, etc...\)

So here are the main types of grabbing tools that I'll talk about:

* Pliers \(I'll go over as many types as I can think of off the top of my head. I will miss some. Because there are infinitely many different types of pliers, I'll try to cover the common types\)
* Vice Grips
* Channel Locks
* Tweezers
* Knipex cutter
* Tin snips

## Pliers:

![](/assets/genericpliers.png)Pliers come in many shapes, sizes, and varieties.

The standard type \(pictured above\), are straight nose, needle nose pliers with cerated jaws. The straight nose part says that the jaws are straight, not bent like in angled nose pliers The needle nose part says that the two jaws converge to a point. The cerated jaws means that the inside of the jaws is not smooth, it has cerations \(ridges\) in it for better grabbing. There are also blunt nose, angled nose, smooth jaws and many other types of pliers, but those are the main ones of the main type.

There are also specialty pliers such as c-clip pliers, e-clip pliers, and more for a variety of uses. I think I talked about c-clips and e-clips in the motion system article.

## Vice grips:

![](/assets/vicegrips.png)

Vice grips are a type of locking-plier which can be locked in place. These are used kinda like clamps occasionally and for more stuff like that where you don't want to have to apply pressure.

## Channel Locks

![](/assets/channellocks.png)Channel locks are a variation on slip-joint pliers. They can give you some extra grip on things.

## Tweezers:

Y'all should already know what tweezers are, but there are some types that not everyone knows about. The first is ESD safe tweezers. This means that the tweezers will not give Electro Static Discharge to what you are working on. ESD safe tweezers are a must since static discharge can easily kill any electronics. Also there are non conductive tweezers \(usually ceramic\), which can be nice when working with live circuits.

## Knipex Cutters

Not a grabber, but didn't want to make yet another category for cutters.

Knipex cutters are awesome. Knipex is a name brand, but they're cutters go through everything. They cut piano wire like butter.

## Tin Snips

Tin snips are meant for cutting sheet metal, but they can also cut through almost anything.

# Glues:

There are many types of glues, and people misuse glues all the time. [This site \(Thistothat.com\)](http://www.thistothat.com/) is really great, it tells you what glue to use when attaching two materials together.

I'll go over the main types of glue and their uses

Here are the glues I'll go over

* Elmers
* Hot glue
* Cyanoacrylate
* Epoxy
* E6000
* JB Weld
* PVA glue \(wood glue\)

## Elmers:

Elmers glue is stupid and useless unless you are in kindergaten. Never to be used for anything.

## Hot glue

Hot glue is nice and versatile, but it's also really overused. Use it in a pinch, but never plan on using hot glue, there are almost always better options.

## Cyanoacrylate:

Cyanoacrylate glue \(CA Glue, super glue, crazy glue\) is a high strength adhesive. There are multiple different types of CA glue of different thickness \(viscosity\). The blue is the thinnest, the purple is the middle, and the pink is the thickest.

![](/assets/caglue.png)

Also there is insta-set \(commonly called "The kicker"\) which instantly sets ca glue. However I don't like the smell of the kicker and it makes me sick, so my preferred instant set is standard backing soda. It also adds some material to the glue joint, adding extra strength.

## Epoxy

Epoxy is a pretty broad category of glues but I'm going to try to briefly go over it. Epoxy is usually two part, and once you mix the two parts together \(Do it on a piece of paper or something and mix it with a popsicle stick\). There is everything from 5 minute cure time epoxy to 24 hour epoxy. If you have the time, use 24 hour, it's so much stronger and better. But in a pinch, 5 minute epoxy should work. Epoxy is probably my favorite glue, its really strong and versatile and can be used on many different materials.

## E6000

E6000 is another nice type of glue. It's also pretty versatile and nice.

## JB Weld

JB Weld is a good glue for metals

## PVA glue \(wood glue\)

Wood glue is used for wood. Can't really say more than that.

# Hand Saws:

Saws are dangerous. Don't be stupid. Only use them if you have received tool training.

Now that that is out of the way, let's start having some fun with saws.

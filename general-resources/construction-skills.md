# Construction skills

So this is a rather broad topic. But I'll throw together random guides for whatever tools/construction methods I have experience in and try to throw in as many tips, tricks, and weird hacks I've learned over the years.

This may be one of my longest articles. So I'd probably just recommend just going to the parts you want/need.

Also reading this will be mandatory for using certain tools in the annex in addition to in-person tool training.

Here are the main things I'll go over:

* Measuring
* Fasteners
* Drills
* Hammers/mallets/press
* Grabbing/cutting tools \(pliers, vice grips, etc...\)
* Glues
* Hand saws
* Power saws
* Router
* Sanding
* Soldering 
* Wire handling \(stripping, crimping\)
* Welding
* Machining
* Mills
* Lathes
* CNC
* Vacuum Forming

## Measuring

The ability to measure accurately is one of the most underrated and most difficult parts of engineering. Measuring is our way of quantifying our surroundings.There are many types of measurement devices, but I'll only go over the common ones that you'd use.

### Length

There are many different ways of measuring length. There are rulers and meter sticks which you are all familiar. Also measuring tapes are very useful for longer length. But for accurate measurement a pair of digital calipers or a digital micrometer should be used. Calipers are probably one of my most used tools, and I always carry a pair on me. They allow you to measure outer lengths, inner lengths, and depths. I recommend Mitutoyo Calipers but they are kinda pricey, and you can find a decent pair on amazon for like $15.![](/assets/calipers.png)

Also always use metric. Imperial is stupid. Also make sure your calipers are zeroed before you start measuring.

### Mass

Use a scale. I'm really not sure what else to say about that.

### Time

Use a phone timer or record whatever you want to measure in high speed video and look at the timestamps to figure out time elapsed.

### Temperature

You can always use a normal thermometer, but LASERS! Laser IR thermometers are really fun and practical. Another tool that is super useful. Also some multimeters come with thermistor inputs which can be useful.

### Electricity \(Voltage, current, resistance, all that jazz\)

I already go over Electrical tools in my [Electrical Tools article.](/general-resources/electronics/electrical-tools.md)

## Fasteners:

Basically engineering is just putting things together in different ways, and there are many ways of putting things togethers. Fasteners are great.

### Screws/Bolts

I already went over these in [Structural System.](/general-resources/robotics/structural-system.md)

### Rivets

Rivets are a great more permanent solution than bolts or screws. I rarely use them do to the fact that they are permanent and I make mistakes so modularity is my best friend.

![](/assets/rivets.png)

## Drills

I really like drills, and I use them almost daily. As I am fairly experience, if you watch me drill it may look not look safe, but it is \(fuck you stephane\).

The drill/impact driver combo we have at school is a 20v dewalt system and it's one of the best handheld drills I have used. We also have a nice bit set and impact driver bit set. Also we have a drill press in the back which is nice for drilling straight holes.

So you may think you know how to use a drill, but you probably don't. So I'll go over the different parts of a drill and how to use it. Then I'll do the same with the drill press.

![](/assets/drillparts.png)

One thing to note with all tools is that you need to feel and understand the tool. If the tool is struggling, slow down. Don't push your tools too hard. Getting a feeling for tools only comes with experience but it's really important to pay attention to your tools \(sound, feel, even smell\).

So back to drills.

The most important thing is safety \(it's actually third, but whatever\). So there are a few steps you need to ensure your safety. First, wear eye protection. I know it's a pain, but do it anyway. Secondly, you need proper work holding. Don't drill into the table your working on, but also make sure your piece is clamped down firmly so it doesn't go flying.  Also you your bit needs to be secure in your chuck. To do this in most modern drills you insert the bit into the chuck, and then hold the chuck while pressing the trigger making the drill spin clockwise. To remove the bit you do the same but rotate the drill counterclockwise. Some older drills have a a gear that needs tightening

![](/assets/drillchucktightening.png)This is also how you tighten the chuck on a drill press.

But before you can actually put a bit in, you need to choose a bit. This mainly comes down to experience. Sometimes you can just choose the right size bit and go for it, and sometimes you need to start small, and gradually increase the size. Also there are many different types of bits.

![](/assets/drillbits1.png)

![](/assets/wooddrillbits.png)

Now you have a bit and it is securely chucked into your drill, you can start drilling. Don't try and drill to fast and make sure you are drilling straight.

Drill presses are similar but also fairly different.

One main difference, especially with ours, is that it does not have variable speed control. It is either on or off.

![](/assets/drillpress.png)To change the speed you need to change the ratio on the pulleys in the head. Do not do this. Tell me that you need it changed, and I'll do it for you. It can be dangerous. Also you use the quill \(handle on the right hand side\) to drill. Also on the left hand side there is a depth guide for drilling accurate depths.

## Hammers/mallets/press

So the first thing you need to learn how to do with a hammer is to flip it.

![](/assets/hammerflip.png)Just kidding. Mrs. Elia gets annoyed when you do that, so don't.

So hammers and mallets are pretty self explanatory, but just to clarify the difference. Mallets have a rubbber or wood head, while hammers have metal heads.

One similar pressing device is called a press. The most popular one \(which I'm hoping to add to the annex in the near future\) is the arbor press.

![](/assets/arborpress.png)

Arbor presses are used for excerting a large force on a small surface area, for edxample they are used for press fitting bearings into place.

![](/assets/arborpressbearing.png)

## Grabbing tools \(pliers, vice grips, etc...\)

So here are the main types of grabbing tools that I'll talk about:

* Pliers \(I'll go over as many types as I can think of off the top of my head. I will miss some. Because there are infinitely many different types of pliers, I'll try to cover the common types\)
* Vice Grips
* Channel Locks
* Tweezers
* Knipex cutter
* Tin snips

## Pliers:

![](/assets/genericpliers.png)Pliers come in many shapes, sizes, and varieties.

The standard type \(pictured above\), are straight nose, needle nose pliers with cerated jaws. The straight nose part says that the jaws are straight, not bent like in angled nose pliers The needle nose part says that the two jaws converge to a point. The cerated jaws means that the inside of the jaws is not smooth, it has cerations \(ridges\) in it for better grabbing. There are also blunt nose, angled nose, smooth jaws and many other types of pliers, but those are the main ones of the main type.

There are also specialty pliers such as c-clip pliers, e-clip pliers, and more for a variety of uses. I think I talked about c-clips and e-clips in the motion system article.

## Vice grips:

![](/assets/vicegrips.png)

Vice grips are a type of locking-plier which can be locked in place. These are used kinda like clamps occasionally and for more stuff like that where you don't want to have to apply pressure.

## Channel Locks

![](/assets/channellocks.png)Channel locks are a variation on slip-joint pliers. They can give you some extra grip on things.

## Tweezers:

Y'all should already know what tweezers are, but there are some types that not everyone knows about. The first is ESD safe tweezers. This means that the tweezers will not give Electro Static Discharge to what you are working on. ESD safe tweezers are a must since static discharge can easily kill any electronics. Also there are non conductive tweezers \(usually ceramic\), which can be nice when working with live circuits.

## Knipex Cutters

Not a grabber, but didn't want to make yet another category for cutters.

Knipex cutters are awesome. Knipex is a name brand, but they're cutters go through everything. They cut piano wire like butter.

![](/assets/knipexcutters.png)

## Tin Snips

Tin snips are meant for cutting sheet metal, but they can also cut through almost anything.

![](/assets/tinsnips.png)

# Glues:

There are many types of glues, and people misuse glues all the time. [This site \(Thistothat.com\)](http://www.thistothat.com/) is really great, it tells you what glue to use when attaching two materials together.

I'll go over the main types of glue and their uses

Here are the glues I'll go over

* Elmers
* Hot glue
* Cyanoacrylate
* Epoxy
* E6000
* JB Weld
* PVA glue \(wood glue\)

## Elmers:

Elmers glue is stupid and useless unless you are in kindergaten. Never to be used for anything.

## Hot glue

Hot glue is nice and versatile, but it's also really overused. Use it in a pinch, but never plan on using hot glue, there are almost always better options.

## Cyanoacrylate:

Cyanoacrylate glue \(CA Glue, super glue, crazy glue\) is a high strength adhesive. There are multiple different types of CA glue of different thickness \(viscosity\). The blue is the thinnest, the purple is the middle, and the pink is the thickest.

![](/assets/caglue.png)

Also there is insta-set \(commonly called "The kicker"\) which instantly sets ca glue. However I don't like the smell of the kicker and it makes me sick, so my preferred instant set is standard backing soda. It also adds some material to the glue joint, adding extra strength.

## Epoxy

Epoxy is a pretty broad category of glues but I'm going to try to briefly go over it. Epoxy is usually two part, and once you mix the two parts together \(Do it on a piece of paper or something and mix it with a popsicle stick\). There is everything from 5 minute cure time epoxy to 24 hour epoxy. If you have the time, use 24 hour, it's so much stronger and better. But in a pinch, 5 minute epoxy should work. Epoxy is probably my favorite glue, its really strong and versatile and can be used on many different materials.

## E6000

E6000 is another nice type of glue. It's also pretty versatile and nice.

## JB Weld

JB Weld is a good glue for metals

## PVA glue \(wood glue\)

Wood glue is used for wood. Can't really say more than that.

# Hand Saws:

Saws are dangerous. Don't be stupid. Only use them if you have received tool training.

Now that that is out of the way, let's start having some fun with saws.

Here are the three \(main\) kinds of hand saw:

* Basica handsaw 
* Coping saw
* Hack saw
* Bow saw

## Basic handsaw

This is your standard wood handsaw![](/assets/basichanddswa.png)

It can be used for cutting 2x4s or really any type of wood.

## Coping Saw

This simple but useful cutting tool consists of a thin blade tensioned in a C-shaped frame that uses interchangeable blades for both metal and wood. It can cut tight radiuses but perhaps its most useful feature is the ability to remove the blade and thread it through a drilled hole to cut inside profiles.

![](/assets/coping saw.png)

## Hack Saw

This type of handsaw features a fine-toothed blade tensioned in a C-frame. Commonly used for cutting metals and plastics. Take special care to clean it when cutting aluminum, as it will often gum up on softer metals.

![](/assets/hackswa.png)

## Bow Saw

Basically a hacksaw but with a slightly different shape.

![](/assets/bowsaw.png)

# Power saws

Power saws are dangerous. You are not allowed to use them unless Mrs. Elia or I have given you explicit permission to do so.

Here are the types I'll go over:

* Circular saw
* Jigsaw
* Miter\(Chop\) saw
* Bandsaw
* Tablesaw
* Scrollsaw
* Oscillating saw

## Circular Saw

Circular saws are used for cutting straight lines. These are usually used to rip a sheet of wood \(FYI a rip cut is parallel to the grain while a cross cut is perpendicular\)

There are two types of electric circular saws, the worm drive and the sidewinder. The worm drive saw has enough torque to cut through wet lumber and concrete. The behind-the-blade handle placement reduces kickback, and the blade’s left-side position makes it easy to see your cut line if you’re right-handed. The sidewinder’s motor, attached directly to the blade, weighs less but also has less torque.

![](/assets/circularsaw.png)

## Jigsaw

Jigsaws are nice for making intricate cuts. They also usually have a metal and a wood blade for their respective cuts.

![](/assets/jigsaw.png)

## Miter Saw

A chop saw is usually used for cutting planks such as a 2 by 4. A miter saw is a chop saw that can swivel to perform miter cuts which are angled cuts. Some miter saws can cut miters in multiple directions \(saw can rotate around y and z axis\).

![](/assets/mitersaw.png)

## Bandsaw

A bandsaw is kinda like a big jigsaw. It is used for intricate cuts and can do precision work.

Perhaps the most useful saw for cutting both metal and wood, this tool has loads of cutting power and runs very quiet — it won’t wake the neighbors in the middle of the night. Like jigsaws, band saws can drift if you’re not paying close attention to the line.

![](/assets/bandsaw.png)

## Table Saw

Table saws are my least favorite kind of saw even though they are the most versatile. The reason I don't like them is because they are by far the most scary saw. When using them you are leaning into more material and you're facing a big spinning blade. We do not have a table saw but if we did \(note to future leaders of CRC\) make sure to get one with sawstop, because table saws are scary.

Ripping, crosscutting, mitering, and beveling can all be accomplished using the table saw. Usually not very portable, but its versatility makes this one of the most useful tools in a shop.

![](/assets/tablesaw.png)

## Scroll saw

A scroll saw has a very narrow blade for very intricate work.

![](/assets/scrollsaw.png)

## Oscillating Saw

These are kinda gimmaky and useless except maybe for like cutting drywall or something like that.

# ![](/assets/oscillatingsaw.png)Router

I couldn't really think of a category to put routers into, so I'll give it it's own section. Routers are used for removing material.

![](/assets/router.png)

A router is a spinny thing for "routing" material. You can put different bits in for different jobs. For example if you want to add a fillet to a piece of wood to make it look fancy, you'd use a roundover bit. Many people also put routers on 3-axis cnc machines for routing aluminum. For example, the shapeoko and the xcarve are cnc routers. Also the shaper origin is super cool \(Google it. I tried it at NYMF 2016 and it was awesome\).

# ![](/assets/shapeoko.png)Sanding

Sanding is mostly self-explanatory. However there are a few terms y'all should know when it comes to sanding.

* Grit
* Wet vs Dry 
* Sanding tools

The grit of sander determines how much material gets removed. You want to have a very fine grit if you want a smooth surface, and a rough grit if you need to remove a lot of material.

Wet sanding is sanding while wet \(duh\), this gives a really nice finish to parts. Also people use wet sands on fibrous materials \(mainly carbon fiber\) so that the dust gets caught in the water and not in your lungs \(Mesothelioma is bad. Be extremely careful when sanding CF\)

Also there are many different tools for sanding:

* Sandpaper
* Sanding block
* Orbital sander
* Belt sander
* Disk sander

## Sandpaper:

Sandpaper is just sandpaper, it's pretty self explanatory.

## Sanding Block:

A sanding block is sand paper attached to some sort of block \(Doesn't have to be rectangular, sometimes sanding blocks are cylindrical\) to make sanding easier.

## Orbital Sander:

Orbital Sanders are a type of handheld power sander. They allow for easy sanding by having a motor that moves the sanding area in an orbital pattern.

![](/assets/orbitalsander.png)

## Belt Sander:

Belt sanders are sanders that have a sanding belt and the belt gets spun.

![](/assets/beltsander.png)

## Disk Sander:

Disk sanders are big spinning sanding disks.

![](/assets/disksander.png)

# Soldering:

Apparently I'm terrible at explaining how to solder, so here's a video on how to do it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKbJxytERvg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKbJxytERvg)

Also here's a video on desoldering:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N\_dvf45hN6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_dvf45hN6Y)

# Wire Handling

Wires are the most fundamental part of EE, so being able to transform them to suit your needs is of the essence. The two main things you need to do are strip and crimp. Stripping wires is the process of removing the insulation from the wire to expose the conductor. To do this you use wire strippers. There are two kind, the manual and the automatic. We have both in the lab, but I am personally a fan of the manual ones, but the automatic are easier.

This is what the automatic ones look like:

![](/assets/automatic.png)

And here the manual:

![](/assets/manualstrippers.png)Sometimes you want to add connectors to wires to make them easier to remove and reconnect. This is done by crimping connectors to the ends.

I go over most of them in the [Wire article. ](/general-resources/electronics/wire.md)so I won't go over them here.

# Welding:

You probably won't end up welding in school \(I'm not sure G-Snydes would appreciate that\), but knowing the different types and their uses is still important. There are 4 main types of welding:

* MIG \(GMAW\)
* TIG
* Arc \(SMAW\)
* FCAW

## MIG:

In Metal Inert Gas \(MIG\) welding, \(Sometimes called gas metal arc welding \(GMAW\)\), a shielded gas is used along the wire electrode, which heats up the two metals to be joined. A constant voltage and direct current power source is required for this method, and this is the most common industrial welding process. The MIG or GMAW process is suitable for fusing mild steel, stainless-steel as well as aluminium.

## TIG:

A non-consumable tungsten electrode is used in TIG \(Tungsten Inert Gas\) or GTAW \(Gas Tungsten Arc Welding\). This tungsten electrode is made use of to heat the base metal and create a molten weld puddle. By melting two pieces of metal together, an autogenous weld can be created. For this type of welding, the welder needs to have a lot of expertise as it’s a very complex process. This welding process is employed to carry out high-quality work when a superior standard finish is required, without making use of excessive clean up by sanding or grinding.

## Arc:

Arc welding is also called as Shielded Metal Arc welding, or simply referred to as ‘Stick’. This is the most basic of all welding types. The welding stick uses electric current to form an electric arc between the stick and the metals to be joined. To weld iron and steel, this type of welding is often used in the [construction of steel structures](http://northern-weldarc.com/different-types-uses-steel-beams/) and in industrial fabrication. Stick welding can be used for manufacturing, construction and repair work.

## FCAW:

As an alternative to shield welding, Flux-cored Arc Welding was developed. This welding process is quite similar to MIG or GMAW process, except for the fact that in FCAW a special tubular wire filled with flux is used and shielding gas is not always needed, depending on the filler. This type of welding is well-known for being extremely inexpensive and easy to learn. However, there are several limitations in its applications and the results are not often aesthetically pleasing as some of the other welding methods. The semi-automatic arc is often used in construction projects, thanks to its high welding speed and portability.

# Machining:

Machining is such a broad topic \(People spend decades working to become machinists\), but I'm going to try and go over all of it in a few paragraphs.

Here are the main types of machining:

* Drilling
* Boring
* Reaming
* Milling
* Turning

Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching and sawing. Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included within the category of machining.

### Drilling

Drilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two or four helical cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpiece to form the round hole.

### Boring

In boring, a tool with a single bent pointed tip is advanced into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a fine finishing operation used in the final stages of product manufacture.

### Reaming

Reaming is one of the sizing operations that removes a small amount of metal from a hole already drilled.

### Milling

Milling is the machining process of using rotary cutters to remove material\[1\] from a workpiece by advancing \(or feeding\) the cutter into the workpiece at a certain direction\[2\]. The cutter may also be held at an angle relative to the axis of the tool.\[3\] Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. It is one of the most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances.

Milling can be done with a wide range of machine tools. The original class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine \(often called a mill\). After the advent of computer numerical control \(CNC\), milling machines evolved into machining centers: milling machines augmented by automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC capability, coolant systems, and enclosures. Milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining centers \(VMCs\) or horizontal machining centers \(HMCs\).

### Turning

In turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape. The primary motion is provided by rotating the workpiece, and the feed motion is achieved by moving the cutting tool slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Turning is what is done on a lathe.

# Mills:

Mills are what are used for milling. 

More coming...

# Lathes:

Lathes are what are used for turning.

More coming ...

# CNC:

Computer numerical control \(CNC\) is the automation of machine tools by means of computers executing pre-programmed sequences of machine control commands. This is in contrast to machines that are manually controlled by hand wheels or levers, or mechanically automated by cams alone.

In modern CNC systems, the design of a mechanical part and its manufacturing program is highly automated. The part's mechanical dimensions are defined using computer-aided design \(CAD\) software, and then translated into manufacturing directives by computer-aided manufacturing \(CAM\) software. The resulting directives are transformed \(by "post processor" software\) into the specific commands necessary for a particular machine to produce the component, and then are loaded into the CNC machine.

Since any particular component might require the use of a number of different tools – drills, saws, etc. – modern machines often combine multiple tools into a single "cell". In other installations, a number of different machines are used with an external controller and human or robotic operators that move the component from machine to machine. In either case, the series of steps needed to produce any part is highly automated and produces a part that closely matches the original CAD.

# Vacuum Forming:

Vacuum forming is a simplified version of thermoforming, where a sheet of plastic is heated to a forming temperature, stretched onto a single-surface mold, and forced against the mold by a vacuum. This process can be used to form plastic into permanent objects such as turnpike signs and protective covers. Normally draft angles are present in the design of the mold \(a recommended minimum of 3°\) to ease removal of the formed plastic part from the mold.

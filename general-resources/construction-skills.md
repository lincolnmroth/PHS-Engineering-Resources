# Construction skills

So this is a rather broad topic. But I'll throw together random guides for whatever tools/construction methods I have experience in and try to throw in as many tips, tricks, and weird hacks I've learned over the years.

This may be one of my longest articles. So I'd probably just recommend just going to the parts you want/need.

Also reading this will be mandatory for using certain tools in the annex in addition to in-person tool training.

Here are the main things I'll go over:

* Measuring
* Fasteners
* Drills
* Hammers/mallets/press
* Grabbing tools \(pliers, vice grips, etc...\)
* Glues
* Hand saws
* Power saws
* Router
* Sanding
* Soldering 
* Wire handling \(stripping, crimping\)
* Welding
* Machining
* Mills
* Lathes
* CNC
* Vacuum Forming

## Measuring

The ability to measure accurately is one of the most underrated and most difficult parts of engineering. Measuring is our way of quantifying our surroundings.There are many types of measurement devices, but I'll only go over the common ones that you'd use.

### Length

There are many different ways of measuring length. There are rulers and meter sticks which you are all familiar. Also measuring tapes are very useful for longer length. But for accurate measurement a pair of digital calipers or a digital micrometer should be used. Calipers are probably one of my most used tools, and I always carry a pair on me. They allow you to measure outer lengths, inner lengths, and depths. I recommend Mitutoyo Calipers but they are kinda pricey, and you can find a decent pair on amazon for like $15.![](/assets/calipers.png)

Also always use metric. Imperial is stupid. Also make sure your calipers are zeroed before you start measuring.

### Mass

Use a scale. I'm really not sure what else to say about that.

### Time

Use a phone timer or record whatever you want to measure in high speed video and look at the timestamps to figure out time elapsed.

### Temperature

You can always use a normal thermometer, but LASERS! Laser IR thermometers are really fun and practical. Another tool that is super useful. Also some multimeters come with thermistor inputs which can be useful.

### Electricity \(Voltage, current, resistance, all that jazz\)

I already go over Electrical tools in my [Electrical Tools article.](/general-resources/electronics/electrical-tools.md)

## Fasteners:

Basically engineering is just putting things together in different ways, and there are many ways of putting things togethers. Fasteners are great.

### Screws/Bolts

I already went over these in [Structural System.](/general-resources/robotics/structural-system.md)

### Rivets

Rivets are a great more permanent solution than bolts or screws. I rarely use them do to the fact that they are permanent and I make mistakes so modularity is my best friend.

## Drills

I really like drills, and I use them almost daily. As I am fairly experience, if you watch me drill it may look not look safe, but it is \(fuck you stephane\).

The drill/impact driver combo we have at school is a 20v dewalt system and it's one of the best handheld drills I have used. We also have a nice bit set and impact driver bit set. Also we have a drill press in the back which is nice for drilling straight holes.

So you may think you know how to use a drill, but you probably don't. So I'll go over the different parts of a drill and how to use it. Then I'll do the same with the drill press.

One thing to note with all tools is that you need to feel and understand the tool. If the tool is struggling, slow down. Don't push your tools too hard. Getting a feeling for tools only comes with experience but it's really important to pay attention to your tools \(sound, feel, even smell\).

So back to drills.

The most important thing is safety \(it's actually third, but whatever\). So there are a few steps you need to ensure your safety. First, wear eye protection. I know it's a pain, but do it anyway. Secondly, you need proper work holding. Don't drill into the table your working on, but also make sure your piece is clamped down firmly so it doesn't go flying.  Also you your bit needs to be secure in your chuck. To do this in most modern drills you insert the bit into the chuck, and then hold the chuck while pressing the trigger making the drill spin clockwise. To remove the bit you do the same but rotate the drill counterclockwise. Some older drills have a a gear that needs tightening

![](/assets/drillchucktightening.png)This is also how you tighten the chuck on a drill press.

But before you can actually put a bit in, you need to choose a bit. This mainly comes down to experience. Sometimes you can just choose the right size bit and go for it, and sometimes you need to start small, and gradually increase the size. Also there are many different types of bits.

Now you have a bit and it is securely chucked into your drill, you can start drilling. Don't try and drill to fast and make sure you are drilling straight.

Drill presses are similar but also fairly different.

One main difference, especially with ours, is that it does not have variable speed control. It is either on or off.

![](/assets/drillpress.png)To change the speed you need to change the ratio on the pulleys in the head. Do not do this. Tell me that you need it changed, and I'll do it for you. It can be dangerous. Also you use the quill \(handle on the right hand side\) to drill. Also on the left hand side there is a depth guide for drilling accurate depths.

## Hammers/mallets/press

So the first thing you need to learn how to do with a hammer is to flip it.

![](/assets/hammerflip.png)Just kidding. Mrs. Elia gets annoyed when you do that, so don't.

So hammers and mallets are pretty self explanatory, but just to clarify the difference. Mallets have a rubbber or wood head, while hammers have metal heads.

One similar pressing device is called a press. The most popular one \(which I'm hoping to add to the annex in the near future\) is the arbor press.

Arbor presses are used for excerting a large force on a small surface area, for edxample they are used for press fitting bearings into place.

## Grabbing tools \(pliers, vice grips, etc...\)

So here are the main types of grabbing tools that I'll talk about:

# Facebook Groups

Here’s a list of facebook groups for anyone \(scioly, crc, om, anybody who wants to learn how to build stuff\) learning how to build cool things.

One of the things you may realize is that there are a lot of owner’s groups. I still recommend joining just to lurk and see what people are up to in those groups.

Also make sure you read the pinned post in all groups you join. Many of these groups are very strict and you will be banned if you do not follow the rules.**

##### Sensing System:

Without knowledge of their surrounding, robots are usually pretty useless \(not always\). I'm not going to go too in depth here, since I'll go very into depth in the electronics article.

###### Distance:

Knowing distance to objects is very important. The three main ways of doing this are using infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and LIDAR Sensors.

###### encoders

Encoders measure how much rotation has happened on a shaft. [PJRC](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html) has a good site on them.

###### cameras

Cameras can also be used for a lot of purposes, it just requires very complicated code to understand the data.

###### IMU

IMUs or Inertial Measurement Units measure  body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body

###### GPS

GPS measures position relative to the earth

###### Color Sensor

Color sensors measure colors

###### Tactile, resistive, capacitive physical

Knowing if the robot is being touched in any way is useful for knowing if it hit something or not.

Apologies for this section being pretty dinky, but I'll go into more detail in the electronics article.

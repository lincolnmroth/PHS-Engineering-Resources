# Software System \(WIP\)

Software is not my area of expertise \(I prefer real engineering\), but I'll go over general software for robotics. I won't go over programming arduinos and RPI's and that kinda stuff, as it will be in the [Microcontrollers](/general-resources/electronics/micro-controllers.md) article.

Programming for robots is very different than the programming you will be used to from your classes in school or wherever you've done CS before.

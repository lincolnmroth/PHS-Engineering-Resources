##### Control System:

Choosing a controller for your robot is a pretty simple task. If you do not need a full operating system, you go with arduino. If you need an OS, but you do not need a particularly power processor, you use a raspberry pi. If you need a lot of power, you go with something fancy like a full blown computer or a NVIDIA Jetson TK1. I'll go into more detail about the pros and cons in the electronics doc.

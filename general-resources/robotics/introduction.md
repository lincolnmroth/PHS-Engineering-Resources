# Robotics

So robotics is a pretty broad topic and there's a lot of information, so I'll try to focus on more general topics.

Also, I'm not going to try and explain physics, since my physics knowledge is rather limited. If you want to learn physics, go watch walter lewin on youtube, his lectures are straight up magic.

### Anatomy of a robot:

So robots have a few main systems that together make the entire robot.

I will go through all of the systems in more depth later on.

#### Drive System:

The drive system is how the robot moves itself. Some robots are stationary, but many robots can move. Here are the main types of ways robots can move:

* Wheels
* Treads
* Walking
* Flying \(Propellers\)

#### Motion System:

The motion system is how the robot moves to interact with the world. For example, an arm or grabber. There are so many different types of motion system, I won't try and name all of them, but just think of any way robots can move and that is part of the motion system.

#### Structural System:

The structural system is how everything attaches and is supported in the bot.

#### Sensing System:

The sensing system is how a robot get information about the environment it's in. There are infinitely many ways of sensing the environment, but here are a few:

* Knowing where objects are around the robot \(walls, humans, anything\)
* Detecting obstruction
* Knowing direction
* Knowing GPS location

#### Control System:

The control system is the brain of a robot and the software to control it, which interacts with all of the other parts of the robot. Here are some examples of common controllers used in robotic, from least powerful to most powerful:

* Arduino
* Teensy
* Beaglebone
* Raspberry Pi
* NVIDIA Tegra
* Full Computer

#### Power System:

The power system is how every part of the robot gets power. Usually robots are powered by batteries, but some have alternative power sources.

#### Communication System \(the nervous system\):

The communication system is how everything communicates within a robot. This may seem as simple as just plugging wires together, but choosing what type of wire and how to route it is no easy task.

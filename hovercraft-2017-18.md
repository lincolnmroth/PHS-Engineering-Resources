# Hovercraft 2017-18

This hovercraft was built for the Science Olympiad event Hovercraft in 2017-18.

### Design:

I didn't spend much time designing this \(which ended up proving to be a HUGE mistake\), because our hovercraft from the previous year was pretty good. My basic plan was this: keep everything from the previous year and swap the LiPo \(Lithium Polymer\) battery for a NiMh \(Nickel-Metal Hydride\), as LiPo's were not allowed in this year's competiition.

[Here](http://a360.co/2FSZ7D1) is the rudimentary CAD model I threw together in September.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-03-17 at 12.40.28 PM.png)

Basically I had one hover fan blowing downward and one for propelling the craft forward.

### Construction:

As I had a rather busy start to my junior year, I did not start working on hovercraft until about a week before our competition, Islip. After finishing the first construction, I realized that it did not go forward at all, which was rather problematic. Luckily, Islip got cancelled, so I had more time to get hovercraft working. Again, I got pretty busy and did not start working on hovercraft again until about a week before the next competition, Princeton. I changed the design of the skirt from an open hole in the bottom, to a ribbed design. This did prove helpful, and I did get it to move forward \(rather slowly, but it did go forward\). I was taking the ACT the same day as Princeton, so someone else had to compete with the craft, and did not get it working. I didn't want the next competition SOUP \(SciOly at UPenn\) to be as bad as the previous, so I completely redesigned the craft. I kept the same battery, but I went with new fans. I got[ this fan](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/108-BFB1212GH-AF00) to be the hover fan, and [this one](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/978-9GA0612P1K60) to be the thrust fan. I chose these because the rules disallowed brushless motors, unless they were part of a "consumer" fan, so I bought high power brushless server fans. These were much better, and I got the hovercraft to work for SOUP, where it did reasonably well. I wanted it better for States, so I made a few slight modifications. I got the hovercraft working well about a week before States and did not touch it again until the night before states. I did a few test runs the night before and it seemed to work fine. But somehow, when we got to states and it was time for the event, it did not move forward at all, which was very sad. We managed to get 11th because we did well on the test, but we should have easily gotten top 5 if the hovercraft worked as it should have.

### Summary:

##### What went well:

* The motors I chose for upenn were very good
* NiMh was the best choice for battery
* The hovercraft did well at UPenn

##### What went poorly:

* I should have spent WAY more time designing and planning everything out
* I did a rather poor job on the actual construction, It was like 90% hot glue by states
* I should have done WAY more testing

In conclusion, I'm very disappointed with how hovercraft went, and a few simple changes would have made it much better.

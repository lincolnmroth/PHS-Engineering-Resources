# Introduction

This will be where I will try document projects I worked on, so that future students don't have to make the same mistakes I did. I'm going to try to make it in a blogish format, but I'm really bad at writing/english, so it's probably not going to be great writing, but hopefully it has at least some useful information in it. Also the info on anything built before 2018 is probably going to be kinda dinky as I started this in 2018.

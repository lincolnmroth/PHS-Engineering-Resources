# Mousetrap Vehicle 2017-18

This Mousetrap Vehicle was built for Science Olympiad 2017-18

### Design1:

I went through two main design iterations for Mousetrap. My first one was a very basic design that is similar to what everybody had. I started with a chassis that was 1/4" plywood from home depot. Also to make the wheels and axles, I went with standard CD's and a 8mm diameter  dowel. To reduce friction I used bearing from fidget spinners to support the axles. [Here is a link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/aaa13436fa27577def1beaaa/w/f96d4d3f3def93f55f44c9bd/e/b8c01649af4b922cc4083e68) to the first CAD Model I made.

### Construction1:

I built the design I had very soon before regionals the first competition the mousetrap was at. The first issue I ran into was that my design would not run at all. My first design had one mousetrap powering each axle in opposite directions, but it ended up that once the first mousetrap finished, it locked the axle in place not allowing for the other mousetrap to move the vehicle. I fixed that by  changing the direction switching mechanism to being wrapped around a screw driven into the axle to change the direction of the winds. I ran into some more issues where It would not go far enough. I ended up getting lucky at regionals and placed 6th. I was decently happy with this placement, but I was not happy with the design, as it was very hard to align the bearing and the wheels, and nothing worked without putting super lube on everything.  So, I decided to redesign the entire vehicle.

As you can see, it was pretty sketchy.

### Design2:

My second design was way over-engineered. It used a carbon fiber chassis, banebots wheels, and aluminum axles.

Here is a list of the parts I used

[Banebots t40 2-7/8" wheels,](http://www.banebots.com/product/T40P-295BA-HS4.html) for the rear drive axle.

[Banebots t40 1-3/8"](http://www.banebots.com/product/T40P-145BA-HS4.html), for the front axle

### Construction2:

This was one of the more difficult builds I have done. This was mainly due to the fact that carbon fiber is an absolute bitch. If you do not take the necessary safety precautions, you will get cancer, and if you do not use the right tool, you will destroy your tool. I cut the carbon fiber sheet to size and drilled all the necessary holes while being very careful. The rest the vehicle assembly went rather smoothly. I was initially planning on using the brass rod as the lever arm, but it was way to flimsy, so I ended up going with some of the 8mm dowel I had from before. But to attach the dowel to the mousetraps, I put the brass rod through through the dowel, and then soldered the brass rod onto the mousetraps, which was very rigid, and worked great. to attach the string to the axle, I super glued a small piece of brass to the axle, which proved to be a terrible way of attaching a string to an axle. This worked well enough for SOUP, but the braking mechanism slightly failed, but still managed to fix itself. To fix this braking mechanism, I designed [a small part ](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/151af7b0d91c5ec9db01aa5d/w/1114c86746e36ceb84a6fc55/e/b7a8f5a5e1e02b67876e2758)to tie the string to instead of the small piece of brass. One major issue I realized was that when going backwards and it stopped, the vehicle had enough kinetic energy that it would pull the lever arm back and have to go back and forth a few times before this time. I did not have enough time to fix this, and it ended up being a major problem. At states we were more accurate than most teams, but our time score was almost double most other teams due to the flawed braking mechanism, so we ended up getting 8th, which I was rather disappointed by, since it had the potential to be top 3 with only like a few hours of work.

### Summary:

##### What went well:

* The carbon fiber chassis was very rigid, and very light
* The wheels were very good, and the hubs kept them very straight
* the axle had very little flex
* the bearings spun freely
* the soldered lever arm was very rigid

##### What went poorly:

* The braking mechanism should've been better
* Having C-Clip pliers would have been very helpful
* I should have calibrated at school, where I would have had more space, and a more accurate surface

In conclusion, it should have done much better, but was mediocre
